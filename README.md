# Kenny-Portfolio-Project

This is my portfolio which includes:

A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
An About page/section with a little bit about you
A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link
